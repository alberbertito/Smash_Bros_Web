			<p id="description" class="description"> Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / for Wii U is the fourth edition of the Smash Bros. franchise, being the first edition playable in a portable console. </br> </br>
			
			There are near 60 different characters, every one with their different techniques and strategies. </br></br>
			
			In this game every frame is important. The game works at 60 fps (frames per second), so a single frame may seem useless, but the fact that in this game the slowest attacks come out at frame 14-15, about a quarter of a second.</br></br>
			
			That's why it's worth mastering the bigger amount of advanced techniques possible. A difference of a frame may mean win or lose a stock. In a 2-stocks metagame this is very important.</br></br>
			
			It's impossible to cover all the particular techniques of each character, but in this webpage you have the most common techniques that every character can perform. <strong>Happy smashing!</strong>
