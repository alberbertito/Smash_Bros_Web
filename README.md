"#Smash_Bros_Web" 

Creating the HTML structure:

First of all the "index.html" was created. A table displays the different techniques in the game.
The "index.html" has a menu with the logo of the game and a main menu bar in the same division.
The other two divisions were created to contain the footer with another menu bar and to contain 
the main content of the webpage, where the code is going to load dynamically.

The main menu has 4 options with an HTML page for each: Home (return to "index.html"), About the game (brief 
introduction about what is the game), Glossary (a table that displays technical vocabulary that may be useful 
to play the game) and About us (contact details, social media, etc.).

There are 8 advanced techniques explained in their respective HTML page. Only the actual content is loaded
in the division named content as well. The menu and the footer are static.

There is a folder with all the images that the webpage needs to load, called "images".

There are no external APIs used or libraries.


CSS:
"mystyles.css"
Several different styles are created for the tables, titles and descriptions. A few CSS3 Animations are 
implemented, as well as styles for the mouse hover in different elements of the webpage, like tables or photos.


Javascript:
"functions.js"
In this file there are all the functions needed for the webpage to be dynamic. All the functions load when 
their respective link is clicked in the menu or in the main table that displays the techniques. No more 
Javascript other that this is needed for the webpage to work properly.
